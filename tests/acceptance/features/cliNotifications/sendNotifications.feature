Feature: send notifications using the occ command

  As an administrator
  I want to be able to send notifications to the owncloud users
  So that I can inform them about the necessary things


  Scenario: administrator should be able to send a notification with subject and message to a user
    Given user "Alice" has been created with default attributes and without skeleton files
    When the administrator sends following notifications using the occ command
      | subject       | message                                          | user  |
      | Quota updated | Congratulations your oC quota has been increased | Alice |
    Then the command should have been successful
    And user "Alice" should have 1 notification
    And the last notification of user "Alice" should match
      | key     | regex                                            |
